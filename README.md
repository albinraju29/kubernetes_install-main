# Kubernetes Install Scripts / Configurations

This repository contains scripts, configurations, and manifests to help set up Kubernetes environments using different tooling: **kind**, **kubeadm**, **minikube**, and **ingress** setup.

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

| Directory   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `kind/`     | Configs & scripts to set up Kubernetes using **kind** (Kubernetes in Docker) |
| `kubeadm/`  | Manifests & scripts for Kubernetes setup using **kubeadm** |
| `minikube/` | Setup instructions / configurations for **minikube** |
| `ingress/`  | Ingress controllers, rules, example ingress manifests, etc. |

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A system / VM with at least **2 CPU cores**, **2 GB RAM** (ideally more)  
- **Docker** installed if you are using `kind`  
- **kubectl** installed and configured  
- For `kubeadm`, the machine(s) should have:
  - Swap disabled  
  - Proper hostnames, networking setup  
  - SSH access  
  - (Optional) Container runtime installed

## 🚀 How to Use

Below are example steps for each method. Use the one that fits your setup.

### Using **kind**

1. Go into the `kind/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd kind
````

2. Run the setup script (if provided) or create cluster:

   ```bash
   kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
   ```

### Using **kubeadm**

1. Go into `kubeadm/`:

   ```bash
   cd kubeadm
   ```
2. Follow initialization steps:

   ```bash
   kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml
   ```
3. After initialization, set up networking (e.g. `calico.yaml`, `weave`, etc.)

### Using **minikube**

1. Go into `minikube/`:

   ```bash
   cd minikube
   ```
2. Start minikube:

   ```bash
   minikube start --driver=<driver>
   ```

### Ingress setup

1. Enter `ingress/`:

   ```bash
   cd ingress
   ```
2. Apply ingress controller manifests and your ingress rules:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ingress-controller.yaml
   kubectl apply -f ingress-rules.yaml
   ```

## 🧩 Example Workflow

Here’s a possible flow if you want a simple local cluster:

1. Use **kind** to spin up a cluster.
2. Deploy ingress controller via `ingress/`.
3. Use `kubeadm/` (if you want to replicate a cluster on real VMs).
4. Use `minikube/` for a lightweight local dev environment.

---

## 🛡 Troubleshooting & Tips

* Make sure ports required by ingress (80, 443) are not blocked.
* For kind, ensure Docker is running and that your config file references correct CIDRs.
* For kubeadm, match kubelet, kubeadm, kubectl versions.
* After cluster setup, check `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl get pods -A` for status.
* Use `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` for debugging failing pods.
